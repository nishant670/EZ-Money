/**
 * Four slides, one capability each: say it, Finnri reads it, split it, Finnri
 * watches it.
 *
 * Four, not five. The fifth was a "You're all set to take control!" celebration
 * for an account that did not exist yet and a user who had logged nothing — and
 * the signup flow then celebrated a second time on the screen after it. The one
 * celebration left is the one that follows an actual event.
 *
 * Staying at four through a feature refresh meant spending the slots rather
 * than adding to them. Reviewing a parsed entry had a slide of its own saying
 * what the slide before it had already said, so it became one line on that
 * slide's card, and splitting — the thing people open the app for with someone
 * else standing next to them — took the slot it left.

            That reach is what four builds of a dead Skip button were actually
            about. It was read as the dots covering Skip, and the three fixes
            aimed at the dots — absolute positioning, `zIndex: -1`,
            `pointerEvents="none"` — all missed, because the thing on top was
            the animated slide below: giving `screenContainer` a background
            tints this whole row, and swapping `Animated.View` for a plain
            `View` brings the button back to life. The slide has no background
            of its own, so the overlap was invisible and only ever showed up as
            a control that would not respond. Skip now lives in the footer,
            which the slide does not reach, and this keeps the dots out from
            under it too. */}
