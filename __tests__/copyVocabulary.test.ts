/**
 * The words the app uses for destructive and structural actions.
 *
 * This is X10 from the UX backlog, held as a test rather than as a decision
 * somebody has to remember. The screens had drifted into a second vocabulary —
 * *Tweak this* for Edit, *Forget this transaction* for Delete — and the drift
 * was not uniform, which is what made it a defect rather than a style: the same
 * transaction swiped in the list said **Edit** and **Delete**, and opened said
 * **Tweak this** and **Forget this transaction**. One object, one action, two
 * names, and the reader had to work out whether *Forget* meant deleted or
 * merely hidden.
 *
 * The rule is not "no personality". Warmth belongs in empty states, success
 * moments, onboarding and prompts, and none of those are swept here. It belongs
 * nowhere near a button that destroys something, because a playful label on a
 * destructive action is asking the user to guess what it does.
