/**
 * The shapes a screen wears while it is still empty.
 *
 * `Shimmer` is one block. This is the vocabulary built out of it, and it exists
 * for the same reason `useMotion` exists: a placeholder is only worth more than
 * a spinner if it is the *right* shape, and "the right shape" is a set of
 * measurements — a 48px icon circle, a 24px card radius, a 12px gap to the next
 * row — that already live in the components being stood in for. Spelled again
 * at each call site they drift, and a skeleton that drifts is a screen that
 * jumps when the data lands, which is the failure it was added to prevent.
 *
 * ## Why a spinner was the wrong answer everywhere it was used
 *
 * A spinner says "wait". It does not say what for, it occupies none of the
 * space the answer will need, and it is identical on nine screens that look
 * nothing alike. The whole cost of the wait is then paid twice: once looking at
 * nothing, and again when the content lands and shoves the layout into place.
 *
 * ## Every skeleton is invisible to a screen reader
 *
 * A placeholder is a drawing of content that does not exist yet. Announcing
 * eight rows of nothing is worse than announcing nothing at all, so the shapes
 * are hidden and the *frame* carries one honest label — "Loading transactions"
 * — which is the one thing a screen reader user actually needs from this state.
 * `Shimmer` hides itself; `SkeletonFrame` supplies the label.
 */

/**
 * How many sweep slots one row and one card each occupy.
 *
 * `Shimmer` offsets its sweep by `index * 0.18` of a cycle, so two blocks handed
 * the same index pulse together. A row draws six blocks and a card six, and
 * giving them a *base* of anything narrower means row 2's icon shares a slot
 * with row 1's amount — the unison this offset exists to break, reintroduced
 * one row down. Callers that stack groups reserve bands in these units.
