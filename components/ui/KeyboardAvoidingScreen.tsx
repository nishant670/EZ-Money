 * the user still lands on a field they cannot see and has to scroll by hand —
 * which is what shipping only the padding actually produced on the account
 * setup screen. The second half measures the focused input and scrolls it up.
 *
 * Android edge-to-edge is why none of this is free: `adjustResize` no longer
 * shrinks the window, so the ScrollView never learns the keyboard exists.
 * `automaticallyAdjustKeyboardInsets` is iOS-only. Measuring it ourselves is
 * the one approach that behaves the same on both platforms — the same
