/**
 * The answer to a question asked through the capture field.
 *
 * Everything numeric on this card came out of the database and travelled here
 * as a number. The server sends figures and labels; the sentence around them is
 * assembled below, and every amount goes through `formatMoney` like every other
 * amount in the app. Nothing here was written by the model.
 *
 * The card always states its own scope. "₹4,820" alone is unfalsifiable — the
 * reader cannot tell whether it covers this month, last month or everything, so
 * they cannot tell whether it is wrong. The subject and the period sit directly
 * under the number, and the row beneath opens the transactions the number was
 * computed from, so the answer is always one tap from its own evidence.
 *
 * ## Layout
 *
 * The card is a stack, not a text column indented under an icon. The earlier
 * version hung everything off the right of a 36pt avatar and to the left of a
 * close button, which left the hero amount reading in a channel about two
 * thirds of the card wide with the figure, its scope and its call to action all
 * four points apart — a wall rather than an answer. The mark and the question
 * are a header row now; the figure owns the full width under it; and the
 * evidence sits below a rule, which is what makes it read as a destination
 * rather than as another line of the answer.
