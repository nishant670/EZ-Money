/**
 * The capture card, shrinking to a pill as the feed scrolls under it.
 *
 * The mic card is ~286px and never changed size, so on an 812dp screen it and
 * the header owned the first viewport outright and the feed started below the
 * fold — permanently, no matter how far you scrolled. This gives that space
 * back after the first flick without moving capture off the screen: at rest it
 * is the full card, and collapsed it is a 56dp pill with the mic still on it.
 *
 * ## Why the collapse distance is not the 120px the backlog asked for
 *
 * The header block is pinned above a scroll view whose frame never changes, so
 * the feed scrolls 1:1 with the finger while this block shrinks. For the top of
 * the feed to stay glued to the bottom of the shrinking card, the card has to
 * lose exactly one pixel of height per pixel scrolled — so the scroll range
 * *is* the collapse distance (expanded height − 56), around 230px in practice.
 *
 * Collapsing over a shorter 120px would run the card up faster than the content
 * beneath it, opening a gap between the pill and the first row that then closes
 * again as you kept scrolling. Same class of correction as S5: the stated
 * number described the intent, not a mechanism that works.
