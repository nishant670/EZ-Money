 * How big the Welcome illustration is allowed to be, given the screen it is on.

 * Welcome used to be a fixed 900dp of content inside a `ScrollView`, which is
 * taller than the usable height of most handsets — so on a real phone the only
 * thing above the fold was the guest button, and Google and the email/mobile
 * link were below it with nothing to suggest they were there. A sign-in screen
 * that hides half its sign-in options is not a scrolling problem, so nothing
 * here makes the scrolling nicer: the layout is sized to fit instead.
 *
 * The illustration is the part that gives, because it is the only part that
 * carries no information. Everything else on the screen — the wordmark, the two
 * lines of copy, the three actions and the two notes under them — has a height
 * it needs, and what is left over after that is what the artwork gets.
