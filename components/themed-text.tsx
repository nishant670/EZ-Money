   * - `muted` — the caption band: eyebrows, hints, the line under a title.
   * - `mutedStrong` — secondary, but still read as prose.

   *   the surface under it is the accent in both.
   * - `positive` / `negative` / `warning` — outcome, error, caution.
   *
   * Each is a token, so it follows the mood and the mode; a literal colour
   * still goes through `style` or `lightColor`/`darkColor`.

 * alone (Tailwind pairs a line height with its *named* sizes only, so
 * `text-lg` is safe and `text-[18px]` is not), and an inline
 * `style={{ fontSize: 18 }}` is the same trap spelled out. The preset's line
 * height then survives the override and boxes a larger glyph than it was
 * measured for, which clips — see `LineHeightRatio`.
 *
 * It only ever *grows* the box. Most overrides in the app are smaller than the
 * preset — `text-[10px]` and `text-[11px]` are 134 of the 148 — and those sit
 * in a roomy line box rather than a clipping one, so returning a derived
 * height for them would re-space a third of the app's text to fix nothing.
 * The rule is `max(preset, derived)`, expressed as "speak only when short".

 * ## A colour className on this component does nothing

 * `ThemedText` always passes a `color` in its `style` array, and NativeWind

 * rules in `specificityCompare`, so the last colour applied is always this
 * one. A `text-white` class on this component therefore renders the theme's
 * ink, not white: near-black in light mode and near-white in dark, which is
 * how a badge on the orange accent came to be black on the light theme and
 * white on the dark one while the icon beside it — a plain `color` prop —
 * stayed white in both.
 *
 * Colour is set through props, not classes: {@link ThemedTextProps.tone} names
 * the rank of ink, `lightColor`/`darkColor` override a one-off, and
 * `style={{ color }}` takes a literal. `className` is still the right place for
 * everything that is not colour.
