/**
 * The push transition for split's three full-screen screens — group detail,
 * members, settings.
 *
 * They used to lean on `Modal`'s built-in slide, which was dropped when the
 * feature moved onto the app's own motion vocabulary. Dropping it alone was a
 * regression: React Native's `Modal` defaults to `"none"`, so a group detail
 * that used to push in started appearing instantly, which reads as a glitch
 * rather than as speed.
 *
 * `animationType` is not the way back. It is a fixed platform curve at a fixed
 * platform duration, so it cannot honour `Motion.duration.sheet` and — the part
 * that actually matters — it cannot be turned off for reduced motion. This runs
 * the same travel off the same token the bottom sheet uses, and degrades to no
 * animation at all when the user has asked for that.
 *
 * ## Why the travel is a transform and not a layout animation
 *
 * The obvious spelling is `entering={SlideInRight}` / `exiting={SlideOutRight}`.
 * It was, and it cost a day. Reanimated's *layout* animations constrain the
 * animated view's children on Android: an absolutely positioned descendant gets
 * measured against the animating box rather than the container, and its hit box
 * is clipped to whatever overlaps. Group detail's "Add expense" pill was the
 * casualty — 196px of visible button reporting a 51px touch target, so every
 * tap on it missed and the button looked simply dead. Nothing about the pill
 * was wrong; five rewrites of it changed the number and never fixed it.
 *
 * A shared value driving `translateX` through `useAnimatedStyle` is the same
 * motion with none of that: it is an ordinary transform on an ordinary view, so
 * children lay out and hit-test exactly as they would standing still.
 *
 * ## Why it owns the close
 *
 * An exit animation needs the leaving view to still be mounted while it plays,
 * and these modals are rendered conditionally by the screen above them — the
 * moment `onClose` runs, the parent drops them and there is nothing left to
 * animate. So `close` is handed *down* to the content instead: it plays the
 * exit, and only then tells the parent. Children get it as a render prop rather
 * than a prop on a wrapper element, because both the header's back button and
 * Android's hardware back have to go through the same door.
